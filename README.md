Framework to work with Corrently Invest Tokens (CORI) in a similar way as with notes. Having CORI Tokens hold renewable generation capacity as a bound value and actual production over time as a derived (secondary) substition.

The business case of this framework is to make it easier to transfer digital value bound to an asset in the context of a Corrently based ecosystem. CorrentlyNote could be compared to the mimics of a cheque, where one entity bounds a value in order to transfer to another entity. The receiving entity may not be known by the time the cheque (note) gets signed.
